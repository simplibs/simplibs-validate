# raise_invalid — Unconditional Validation Exception Trigger

## Purpose
The `raise_invalid()` function provides a direct shortcut for raising
structured validation exceptions without re-evaluating conditions. It is
designed for the "happy path" pattern where control flow guards have already
detected a failure condition inline.

---

## 1. Execution Pipeline

1. **Bypassing Evaluation Logic:**
   * Unlike `validate()`, this function **never calls** `rule(value)` or
     `rule.is_valid(value)`.
   * It assumes the calling context has already determined validation
     failure.

2. **Exception Construction & Dispatch:**
   * **`isinstance(rule, Rule)`:** Delegates exception construction to
     `rule.build_exception()`.
   * **Callable / Lambda:** Delegates construction to the universal fallback
     factory `build_validation_error()`.
   * The resulting exception is raised immediately (`NoReturn`).

---

## 2. Design Choices & Rationale

### Semantic Distinction from `validate()`
* Using `validate()` makes sense when the developer wants the library to
  evaluate the condition and trigger errors automatically.
* Using `raise_invalid()` is ideal under an `if not condition:` block,
  explicitly communicating intent: *"The condition has already been checked;
  now assemble and raise the diagnostic error card."*
* Avoids double-executing potentially expensive rule logic.
