# AllOf — Logical AND Container Validation Rule

## Purpose
The `AllOf` rule aggregates multiple validation rules or callables,
requiring an input value to satisfy ALL contained rules (logical
conjunction / AND). It is also the rule constructed under the hood by
`Rule.__and__`/`Rule.__rand__` (`rule1 & rule2`).

---

## 1. Execution Rationale & Short-Circuit Evaluation

* **Constructor Fail-Fast:**
  Requires at least one child rule during initialization via
  `raise_requires_at_least_one_rule_error` (`ParamError`).
* **Short-Circuit Evaluation:**
  Uses Python's native `all()` to short-circuit upon encountering the first
  failing rule.
* **Child Exception Delegation:**
  In `build_exception`, iterates through rules, finds the first failing
  rule, and delegates exception generation to `build_child_exception`.

---

## 2. Self-Flattening Constructor

* **Why It's Needed:**
  `Rule.__and__` builds `AllOf` instances one pair at a time, so a chained
  expression like `a & b & c` evaluates left-to-right as `(a & b) & c`,
  which — without flattening — would construct a nested
  `AllOf(AllOf(a, b), c)` rather than a flat `AllOf(a, b, c)`.
* **Why Nesting Would Be a Problem:**
  `build_exception` delegates to the *first failing sub-rule* via
  `build_child_exception`. For a nested `AllOf`, that delegation would
  correctly recurse into the inner `AllOf.build_exception()` and still
  surface the true failing rule's card — so nesting wouldn't break
  diagnostics the way it would for `AnyOf` — but it would still create
  needless extra object instances and an unnecessarily deep call chain on
  every evaluation. Flattening keeps `AllOf` consistent with `AnyOf` and
  avoids that overhead.
* **How It Works:**
  During `__init__`, every positional `rule` argument is inspected with
  `type(rule) is AllOf` (exact type match, not `isinstance`, so a
  deliberate `AllOf` subclass overriding behavior is never silently
  unwrapped). Matching instances contribute their own `.rules` directly
  instead of themselves, applied at every position in the argument list —
  not just the first — so both `(a & b) & c` and `c & (a & b)` flatten to
  the same `AllOf(a, b, c)`.
* **Applies Equally to Manual Construction:**
  This also fixes `AllOf(AllOf(a, b), c)` written by hand, not just
  operator-chained expressions.

---

## 3. Exception Card Design

* **Transparent Delegation:** Vends the exact child exception card of the
  failing sub-rule.
