# raise_requires_at_least_one_rule_error — Empty Rule List Guard

## Purpose
Raises a `ParamError` when a composite/container rule (such as `NoneOf`,
`AnyOf`, `AllOf`) is instantiated without passing any rule arguments.

---

## 1. Execution Rationale

* **Fail-Fast Initialization:**
  Prevents instantiation of logical containers that have no underlying
  rules to evaluate, avoiding ambiguous runtime behavior.
* **Reusable Across Composite Rules:**
  Accepts `rule_name` dynamically to serve `NoneOf`, `AnyOf`, `AllOf`, and
  other variadic composite containers.
