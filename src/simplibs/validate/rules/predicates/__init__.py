# Predicates Sub-Package

## Purpose
Root registry and re-export point for all single-purpose atomic rules (predicates).
Predicates represent single, non-composite assertions evaluated directly against an
input value or its structural properties.

## Sub-Packages Registry

| Sub-Package        | Focus Area / Responsibility                                                         |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arithmetic`       | Mathematical calculations and properties (tolerances, divisibility, remainders).    |
| `checkers`         | Parameterless boolean, identity, and emptiness state assertions.                    |
| `collections`      | Structure and contents of containers, sets, sequences, and mappings.                |
| `comparisons`      | Value-based relational operators (equality, inequality, order, numeric ranges).     |
| `introspection`    | Structural inspection of types, interfaces, attributes, callable states, and `len`. |
| `logic`            | Core identity (`is`) and collection membership (`in`) assertions with strict flags. |
| `numeric`          | Specific numeric domain type checks, non-finite values (`NaN`, `inf`), and `bool`.  |
| `strings`          | Textual contents, pattern matching, prefix/suffix checks, and whitespace states.    |
| `_helpers`         | Internal shared utilities for diagnostic rendering and predicate calculation logic. |
| `_init_validators` | Internal constructor assertion routines ensuring valid parameter boundaries.        |
