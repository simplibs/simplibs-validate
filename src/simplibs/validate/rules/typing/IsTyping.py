# IsTyping — Annotation-Driven Validation Rule

## Purpose
The public entry point of this whole sub-package: wraps an arbitrary
typing annotation and validates values against it, by building — once,
at construction time — the equivalent composed Rule tree via
`_dispatch.build_typing_rule()`.

---

## 1. Decomposition Happens in `__init__`, Not `is_valid`

`build_typing_rule(annotation)` recursively walks the entire annotation and
constructs every nested `IsInstance`/`AllOf`/`AnyOf`/`ForEach` up front,
exactly once, when `IsTyping(annotation)` is constructed. `is_valid()`
and `build_exception()` are then pure delegation to that already-built
`self.rule` — repeated validation against the same `IsTyping` instance
(e.g. reused inside a loop, or as a composed_rule building block) never
re-walks the annotation.

---

## 2. `annotation` Is Stored, Even Though `self.rule` Does the Real Work

Kept for introspection/debugging (e.g. `repr(is_typing_instance)` or
future tooling that wants to know what annotation a given `IsTyping`
instance was built from) — `self.rule` alone would not let a caller
recover the original annotation once decomposed.

---

## 3. `build_exception` Delegates Rather Than Re-Deriving

Mirrors `AllOf`/`AnyOf`'s own pattern of delegating to the child rule
that actually failed, rather than constructing a generic "value doesn't
match this annotation" message from scratch. Since `self.rule` is
already the exact composed tree describing the annotation, its own
`build_exception` already produces the most specific diagnostic
available — re-deriving one here would either duplicate that logic or
produce a strictly worse, less specific message.
