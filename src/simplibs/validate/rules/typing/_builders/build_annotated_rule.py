# annotated_builder — ANNOTATED Process

## Purpose
`Annotated[X, ...]` attaches arbitrary metadata to an annotation — see
PEP 593. This library specifically recognizes metadata items that are a
`Rule` instance (or a plain callable predicate) and folds them into the
composed rule for X, which is precisely the mechanism PEP 593 was
designed to enable for frameworks like this one.

---

## 1. How simplibs-validate Rules Attach to typing Annotations

Rather than inventing a separate parallel syntax, `Annotated` is the
sanctioned extension point: `Annotated[int, greater_than(0)]` or `rule.annotated(int)`
reads as ordinary `int` to a type checker (mypy sees strictly `int`), while
IsTyping decomposes it into `AllOf(IsInstance(int), GreaterThan(0))` at
runtime. No new typing-adjacent syntax was needed — this reuses stdlib
machinery exactly as intended.

---

## 2. Plain Callables Are Accepted Too, Not Just `Rule` Instances

Consistent with `validate()`/`Rule.validate()` already accepting a plain
callable (lambda, function) as a predicate alongside `Rule` instances.
A metadata item that is callable but not a `Rule` is wrapped
via `Compose(identity, predicate)` rather than requiring the user to
formally subclass `Rule` just to attach `Annotated[int, lambda v: v > 0]`.

---

## 3. Non-Predicate Metadata Is Silently Ignored, Not Rejected

`Annotated[int, "some docstring", SomeOtherFrameworksField(...)]` is
valid and common — other tools attach their own metadata to the same
annotation, and this library has no business rejecting or erroring on
metadata it doesn't understand. Only items that are a `Rule` or callable
are treated as validation predicates; everything else passes through
untouched, exactly as PEP 593 intends.

---

## 4. Multiple Rule/Callable Metadata Items Compose via AllOf

`Annotated[int, greater_than(0), divisible_by(2)]` combines both — no
conflict handling needed, since combining independent predicates with
AND is always well-defined.
