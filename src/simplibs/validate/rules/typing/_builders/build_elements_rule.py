# elements_builder — ELEMENTS Process

## Purpose
The "container + rule per item" process — the single largest group of
typing constructs this library needs to support, precisely because
`list[T]`, `set[T]`, `Iterable[T]`, `Sequence[T]`, and `Collection[T]` all
reduce to the exact same two checks: is this the right kind of container,
and does every item satisfy one shared item rule.

---

## 1. One Function for Every ELEMENTS-Shaped Origin

No branching on which specific origin triggered this call — `IsInstance`
already handles `list`, `set`, `frozenset`, or any ABC (`Iterable`,
`Sequence`, `Collection`) identically via `isinstance(value, origin)`.
The origin table maps every one of these keys to this same function; the
"which ABC" distinction only matters for building the correct
`IsInstance` argument, which the dispatcher already provides via
`get_origin(annotation)`.

---

## 2. `container_type` Override — Why It Exists

Homogeneous `tuple[int, ...]` also fits the ELEMENTS shape exactly (a
tuple of unbounded length, every element the same type) — but the
dispatcher inspects `get_args()` on `tuple` *before* reaching the origin
table (see IsTyping's design notes on why tuple can't be a table entry),
and by that point it already knows the concrete container is `tuple`. The
`container_type` parameter lets the dispatcher pass that down explicitly,
rather than this function re-deriving it from `get_origin(annotation)` —
which would still correctly return `tuple` here, but re-deriving
something the caller already computed is unnecessary indirection.

---

## 3. Bare Generic (No Type Argument) Falls Back to a Pure Container Check

`get_args(list)` (no subscript) returns `()`. In that case, step 4 is
skipped entirely and `build_elements_rule` returns just
`IsInstance(list)` — equivalent to writing `list[Any]`, which is exactly
the right behavior: no item type was specified, so nothing about item
content should be constrained.

---

## 4. Recursive `build_typing_rule` Import Is Deferred, Not Circular by Accident

`_dispatch.py` imports every builder (via the origin table) at module
load time; if this file imported `build_typing_rule` from `_dispatch` at its own
top level, that would be a genuine circular import. Importing it inside
the function body breaks the cycle at import time while still resolving
correctly the first time this function actually runs.
