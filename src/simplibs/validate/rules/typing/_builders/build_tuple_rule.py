# tuple_builder — Homogeneous & Positional Tuple Processing

## Purpose
Handles all `tuple` origin validations. Because Python tuples can represent
both unbounded homogeneous containers (`tuple[int, ...]`) and fixed-length
heterogeneous structures (`tuple[str, int]`), this builder inspects `get_args()`
to delegate between the shared `build_elements_rule` and dedicated local
positional logic.

---

## 1. Homogeneous vs. Positional Routing

- Unsubscripted `tuple` (args == ()) is equivalent to `tuple[Any, ...]`.
- `tuple[T, ...]` uses Ellipsis as the second argument.
Both shapes delegate to `build_elements_rule(annotation, container_type=tuple)`.
All other subscripted tuple shapes represent fixed-length structures and
are processed positionally.

---

## 2. Per-Position Rules via Closure Predicates

Each position check (`value[index]` satisfies `rule`) uses a lightweight local
closure (`_at_index`). A dedicated `Rule` subclass is omitted to avoid unnecessary
overhead since these checks exist solely within this builder's composed `AllOf`.

---

## 3. Explicit Arity Validation (`HasLength`)

Position checks assume the tuple has sufficient elements. Including
`HasLength(length=len(args))` guarantees that arity mismatches fail gracefully
with a validation error rather than raising an unhandled `IndexError`.
