# type_builder — TYPE Process

## Purpose
`Type[T]` asks whether the value **is itself a class**, optionally one
inheriting from `T` — a statement about the value being a type object,
not about instances of anything. This distinguishes it from every other
builder in this package, which validate instances against a shape.

---

## 1. Union Base Support (`Type[A | B]`)

`type[A | B]`'s single type argument is itself a Union, not a plain
class — `get_origin(base)` detects this the same way `_dispatch.py`
detects a top-level Union, and each member becomes its own
`IsSubclass(member)`, combined with `AnyOf`. This reuses the *detection*
logic conceptually shared with `any_of_builder`, but not the function
itself — `any_of_builder.build_any_of_rule` recursively calls
`build_typing_rule()` on each member (since Union members are usually meant to
be validated as instances), which is wrong here: `Type[A | B]`'s members
must become `IsSubclass` checks, not `IsInstance` checks. Duplicating the
small amount of union-unpacking logic locally was judged clearer than
trying to parametrize `any_of_builder` to serve two different meanings
of "what does a Union member turn into".

---

## 2. Support for `type[Any]` and Unsupported Non-Class Bases

`type[Any]` is supported and explicitly means "any class object at all",
behaving identically to bare `type` / `Type` by returning just `IsType()`.
Because `Any` is a special construct rather than a standard `type` instance,
it is handled as an explicit fast path (`base is Any`) before non-class base
checks.

Conversely, complex parameterizations like `type[SomeGeneric[int]]` or other
non-class, non-Union type arguments remain unsupported and raise
`raise_unsupported_annotation_error`.

---

## 3. Redundancy With `IsSubclass` Itself

Same rationale as the composed-layer `type_rule`'s own design notes:
`IsSubclass.is_valid` already checks `isinstance(value, type)` internally,
so the leading `IsType()` is technically redundant once a base is given —
kept for a consistent base predicate and a clearer first-failure
diagnostic.
