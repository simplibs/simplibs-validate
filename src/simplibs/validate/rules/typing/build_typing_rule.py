# _dispatch — IsTyping's Recursive Decomposition Engine

## Purpose
The single function every annotation — top-level or nested — passes
through exactly once per recursion level. It handles primitives directly
(like `Any`, direct `Rule` instances, or plain `type` objects) and routes
all generic/structured type constructs through `ORIGIN_TABLE`.

---

## 1. Clean Evaluation Pipeline

The dispatch order follows a minimal, strict logic path:

1. **`Any`** — Has no origin and is not a `type` instance; returns the
   `_IS_ANY` singleton directly.
2. **No Origin (`origin is None`)** — Pass-through for direct `Rule` instances,
   handles concrete class types via `IsInstance(annotation)`, unwraps `NewType`
   wrappers recursively, or raises an error for unsupported non-type constructs.
3. **Table Lookup (`ORIGIN_TABLE`)** — Every structured origin (including
   `tuple` and `Annotated` in Python 3.11+) maps directly to its
   specialized builder function.

---

## 2. No-Origin Branch Logic (`origin is None`)

This branch explicitly handles constructs where `get_origin(annotation)` returns `None`:

* **`isinstance(annotation, Rule)` (3.1):** First-class Rule pass-through. If an annotation
  is already a `Rule` instance, no decomposition is needed — it is returned as-is.
* **`isinstance(annotation, type)` (3.2):** High-frequency fast path. Standard class
  types (`int`, `str`, custom domain classes) are `type` instances and directly emit `IsInstance`.
* **`hasattr(annotation, "__supertype__")` (3.3):** In Python 3.11+, `NewType` creates a unique
  wrapper object (not a `type` instance, and with `origin is None`). It stores its underlying type
  in `__supertype__`. We recursively re-enter `build_typing_rule` with the underlying type
  (e.g., `NewType("UserId", int)` unwraps to `int`).
* **Fallback (`raise_unsupported_annotation_error`) (3.4):** Handles unprocessable non-type structures
  without origins, such as bare `TypeVar` (e.g., `T = TypeVar("T")`) or unparsed `ForwardRef` strings,
  raising a clear error.

### Why `Annotated` Metadata Fallback is Omitted
In older Python versions (pre-3.10), `Annotated` sometimes required a fallback inspection via
`hasattr(annotation, "__metadata__")`. Because this library targets **Python 3.11+**, `get_origin(Annotated[...])`
is guaranteed by the standard library to strictly return `typing.Annotated`. Therefore, checking `__metadata__` in
the `origin is None` branch is redundant dead code and deliberately excluded.

---

## 3. Stateless Module-Level Singleton

`_IS_ANY` is instantiated once at module import time and reused across
all `Any` occurrences.

---

## 4. Delegation of Complex Origin Logic

Complex constructs such as heterogeneous vs. homogeneous `tuple` shapes or
`Annotated` metadata extraction do not contaminate the main dispatcher
branching. Their respective builder functions (`build_tuple_rule` and
`build_annotated_rule`) encapsulate their own internal inspection logic
when invoked via `ORIGIN_TABLE`.
