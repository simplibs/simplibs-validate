# is_supported_annotation — Type Annotation Safeguard Predicate

## Purpose
A lightweight, boolean predicate utility designed to verify whether a given type
annotation, class, or typing expression can be successfully compiled into a
Rule by the validation system.

---

## 1. Non-Raising Inspection Logic

Delegates execution directly to `build_typing_rule(annotation)` wrapped in a
`try-except` block. Instead of raising exceptions on unsupported objects, bare
`TypeVar` definitions, or unparsed `ForwardRef` instances, it catches internal
`ParamError` exceptions and gracefully returns `False`.

---

## 2. Deep Structural Decomposition

Because `build_typing_rule` recursively traverses all inner generic arguments
(e.g., nested `Union`, `tuple`, or `dict` shapes), `is_supported_annotation`
validates the entire annotation hierarchy down to its leaf nodes.

---

## 3. Runtime Probe Safeguard

Acts as an architectural safeguard for higher-level decorators and dynamic
validators, allowing them to inspect annotation compatibility prior to full
compilation or function invocation.
