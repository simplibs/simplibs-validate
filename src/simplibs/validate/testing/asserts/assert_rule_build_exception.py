# assert_rule_build_exception (Exception Card Contract Blade)

## Purpose
Verifies that `Rule.build_exception()` produces a well-formed, raisable
`ValidationError` diagnostic card for every invalid value — reusing
`simplibs-exception`'s own `assert_exception_function` rather than
re-implementing raise/type/field checking here.

---

## 1. Execution Rationale & Toolkit Reuse

* **Raising Wrapper:**
  `build_exception()` *returns* an exception rather than raising it (by
  contract — see `Rule`'s design notes: "the exception is only assembled
  and returned"). `assert_exception_function` expects a callable that
  *raises*, so this helper wraps the call in a small local
  `raising_wrapper(value)` that raises whatever `build_exception` returns.
* **Basic Metadata via `assert_exception_function`:**
  Delegates the type check (`ValidationError`), and the `label`/`context`/
  `value` echo-back checks, to `assert_exception_function`.
* **Optional Strict Fields:**
  `expected_error_name` and `expected_exception_type` are opt-in — when
  the calling test knows a rule's fixed `error_name` or wrapped
  `exception` class, it can assert them across every invalid value in one
  call.
* **Value Echo Bypass (`check_value=False`):**
  Rules that transform values before evaluating inner bounds (such as `Compose`)
  will legitimately report the *transformed* value inside `exc.value` instead
  of the raw input `val`. `check_value=False` omits passing `value` to the
  underlying `assert_exception_function`, allowing transformation rules to pass
  the card contract check without false failures.
* **Shape-Only Diagnostic Check (`deep_check=True`):**
  Independently verifies that `expected`, `problem`, and `how_to_fix` are
  non-empty. `how_to_fix` is checked against `(str, tuple, list)` rather
  than `tuple` alone, since built-in rules use either a single string
  (`how_to_fix = "Provide ..."`) or a tuple of strings, depending on the
  rule — asserting `tuple` only would false-fail on the majority of rules
  in this library that pass a plain string.

---

## 2. Fixed Bug: deep_check Was Silently Disabling All Field Checks

An earlier revision passed `deep_check=False` straight through to the
delegated `assert_exception_function` call, tying it to this function's
own `deep_check` parameter's *false* branch. That was wrong:
`assert_exception_function` only calls `assert_exception_fields` at all
when its `deep_check` is truthy — passing `False` doesn't just skip the
"deep" fields, it skips checking `label`, `value`, and `context` too,
silently. The docstring claimed those were delegated and checked; in
practice they never ran.

Fixed by always passing `deep_check=True` to the delegated call (these are
basic metadata checks, not "deep" ones), and using this function's own
`deep_check` parameter only to gate the additional local shape-checks on
`expected`/`problem`/`how_to_fix` below — which is what it was always
meant to control.
